I see. There are a few things you can check if Marp is not working on PowerShell or Command Prompt:

Make sure that you have Node.js installed. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:
node -v
If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download it from the Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Make sure that you have the Marp CLI installed. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:
npm list -g @marp-team/marp-cli
If you do not have the Marp CLI installed, you can install it by running the following command:

npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli
Make sure that you are running the Marp CLI in the correct directory. The Marp CLI needs to be run in the directory where the Marp presentation file is located.
If you have checked all of these things and Marp is still not working, you can try the following:

Restart your computer.
Try running the Marp CLI as an administrator.
Report the issue to the Marp team.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
